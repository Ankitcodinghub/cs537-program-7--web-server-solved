In this assignment, you will be developing a real, working web server. To simplify this project, we are providing you with the code for a very basic web server. This basic web server operates with only a single thread. One of your main tasks is to make the web server multi-threaded so that it is more efficient. Your other main task is to create a shared memory segment which the threads can write to in order to export statistics that can be read by another process.

This project can be completed with a project partner.

Objectives

To create and synchronize threads using pthreads, locks, and condition variables.

To synchronize accesses to a shared buffer with threads in producer/consumer relationships.

To understand the basics of a web server.

To use shared memory across cooperating processes.

To catch signals (such at SIGINT) with a signal handler.

Part A: Multi-Threaded Web Server

A.1 HTTP Background

Before describing what you will be implementing in this project, we provide a very brief overview of a simple web server and the HTTP protocol. Our goal in providing you with a basic web server is that you should be shielded from all of the details of network connections and the HTTP protocol. The code that we give you already handles everything that we describe in this section. If you are really interested in the full details of the HTTP protocol, you can read the specification,

(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html) but we do not recommend this for this project.

Most web browsers and web servers interact using a text-based protocol called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A web browser opens an Internet connection to a web server and requests some content with HTTP. The web server responds with the requested content and closes the connection.

The browser reads the content and displays it on the screen.

Each piece of content on the server is associated with a file. If a client requests a specific disk file, then this is referred to as static content. If a client requests that a executable file be run and its output returned, then this is dynamic content. Each file has a unique name known as a URL (Universal

Resource Locator). For example, the URL www.cs.wisc.edu:80/index.html identifies an HTML file called

‚Äúindex.html‚Äù on Internet host ‚Äúwww.cs.wisc.edu‚Äù that is managed by a web server listening on port 80. The port number is optional and defaults to the well-known HTTP port of 80. URLs for executable files can include program arguments after the file name. A ‚Äú?‚Äù character separates the file name from the arguments and each argument is separated by a ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù character. This string of arguments will be passed to a CGI program as part of its ‚ÄúQUERY_STRING‚Äù environment variable.

An HTTP response (from the server to the browser) is similar; it consists of a response line, zero or more response headers, an empty text line, and finally the interesting part, the response body. A response line has the form version status message . The status is a three-digit positive integer that indicates the state of the request; some common states are 200 for OK , 403 for Forbidden , and 404 for Not found . Two important lines in the header are Content-Type, which tells the client the MIME type of the content in the response body (e.g., html or gif) and Content-Length , which indicates its size in bytes.

Again, you don‚Äôt need to know this information about HTTP unless you want to understand the details of the code we have given you. You will not need to modify any of the procedures in the web server that deal with the HTTP protocol or network connections.

A.2 Basic Web Server

The code for the web server is available from ~cs537-1/projects/web-server . You should copy over all of the files there into your own working directory. You should compile the files by simply typing make . Compile and run this basic web server before making any changes to it! make clean removes .o files and lets you do a clean build.

The helper functions are simply wrappers for system calls that check the error codes of those system codes and immediately terminate if an error occurs. One should always check error

codes! However, many programmers don‚Äôt like to do it because they believe that it makes their code less readable; the solution, as you know, is to use these wrapper functions. We expect that you will write wrapper functions for the new system routines that you call.

A.3 Overview: New Functionality

In this project, you will make the basic web server multi-threaded. You will also be modifying how the web server is invoked so that it can handle new input parameters (e.g., the number of threads to create).

The basic web server that we provided has a single thread of control. Single-threaded web servers suffer from a fundamental performance problem in that only a single HTTP request can be serviced at a time. Thus, every other client that is accessing this web server must wait until the current http request has finished; this is especially a problem if the current http request is a long-running CGI program or is resident only on disk (i.e., is not in memory). Thus, the most important extension that you will be adding is to make the basic web server multi-threaded.

Therefore, the generally preferred approach for a multi-threaded server is to create a fixed-size pool of worker threads when the web server is first started. With the pool-of-threads approach, each thread is blocked until there is an http request for it to handle. Therefore, if there are more worker threads than active requests, then some of the threads will be blocked, waiting for new http requests to arrive; if there are more requests than worker threads, then those requests will need to be buffered until there is a ready thread.

In your implementation, you must have a producer thread (the main thread) that begins by creating a pool of worker threads, the number of which is specified on the command line. Your producer thread is then responsible for accepting new http connections over the network and placing the descriptor for this connection into a fixed-size buffer; in your basic implementation, the producer thread should not read from this connection. The number of elements in the buffer is also specified on the command line. Note that the existing web server has a single thread that accepts a connection and then immediately handles the connection; in your web server, this thread should place the connection descriptor into a fixed-size buffer and return to accepting more connections.

Each worker thread is able to handle both static and dynamic requests. A worker thread wakes when there is an http request in the queue. Once the worker thread wakes, it performs the read on the network descriptor, obtains the specified content (by either reading the static file or executing the CGI process), and then returns the content to the client by writing to the descriptor. The worker thread then waits for another http request.

Note that the producer thread and the worker threads are in a producer-consumer relationship and require that their accesses to the shared buffer be synchronized. Specifically, the producer thread must block and wait if the buffer is full; a worker thread must wait if the buffer is empty. In this project, you are required to use condition variables. If your implementation performs any busy-waiting (or spin-waiting) instead, you will be heavily penalized.

Side note: Do not be confused by the fact that the basic web server we provide forks a new process for each CGI process that it runs. Although, in a very limited sense, the web server does use multiple processes, it never handles more than a single request at a time; the parent process in the web server explicitly waits for the child CGI process to complete before continuing and accepting more http requests. When making your server multi-threaded, you should not modify this section of the code.

A.4 Web Server Specification

Your C program must be invoked exactly as follows:

The command-line arguments to your web server are to be interpreted as follows.

port_num: the port number that the web server should listen on; the basic web server already handles this argument.

threads: the number of worker threads that should be created within the web server. Must be a positive integer.

buffers: the number of request connections that can be accepted at one time. Must be a positive integer. Note that it is not an error for more or fewer threads to be created than buffers. shm_name: the name of shared memory object (described more below)

For example, if you run your program as:

then your web server will listen to port 5003, create 8 worker threads for handling http requests and allocate 16 buffers for connections that are currently in progress (or waiting); it will use shm-9452 as the object name for the shared memory segment. Because everyone will create the file at /dev/shm/ , you have to use a unique file name to avoid conflicts with other people using the same CSL machine.

Therefore, when testing your code, we recommend using a string that is less likely to conflict e.g. your cs_login or some random number.

Once your server is running, you can make a request to it my runinng the client program. If you are on the same lab machine you can simply use localhost as the host:

client localhost 5003 /home.html client localhost 5003 /output.cgi?2

Note in this case, you don‚Äôt need to use the CS department VPN because CSL machines are already on the CS network.

A.5 Web Server Hints

We recommend understanding how the code that we gave you works. We provide the following files:

server.c: Contains main() for the basic web server.

request.c: Performs most of the work for handling requests in the basic web server. All procedures in this file begin with the string ‚Äúrequest‚Äù.

helper.c: Contains wrapper functions for the system calls invoked by the basic web server and client. The convention is to capitalize the first letter of each routine. Feel free to add to this file as you use new libraries or system calls. You will also find a corresponding header (.h) file that should be included by all of your C files that use the routines defined here.

We also provide you with a sample Makefile that creates server, client, and output.cgi. You can type make to create all of these programs. You can type make clean to remove the object files and the executables. You can type make server to create just the server program, etc. As you create new files, you will need to add them to the Makefile.

We anticipate that you will find the following routines useful for creating and synchronizing threads: pthread_create , pthread_mutex_init , pthread_mutex_lock , pthread_mutex_unlock ,

pthread_cond_init , pthread_cond_wait , pthread_cond_signal. To find information on these library

routines: read the man pages. You should also feel free to read the OS book, which contains a great amount of detail on how to build producer-consumer relationships between threads.

Part B: Shared Memory for Statistics

In this part of the project, you will enable your multi-threaded web server to communicate with another process (we call it ‚Äústat process‚Äù) through a shared memory segment to display statistics about the web-server threads. These two processes will run on the same machine. Each web-server thread will periodically write to the shared memory segment with updates about its recent behavior; the stat process collects this information (by reading from the shared memory segment) and periodically displays the information.

B.1 Web server producer thread: create and delete shared memory segments

It is the responsibility of the producer thread of the web server process to create and initialize the shared memory segment.

1. Create a shared memory object. A shared memory segment can be created with shm_open() . Each shared memory segment is identified with a unique shared memory object name; this object name is used to match requests for a particular segment between the server and the clients. You should obtain this object name from the command line. To create a shared memory object with the name

should be both readable and writable and will be created if not exists. 0660 is the filesystem permission if this file is newly created. You will need to read the man page of shm_open() to understand the other details.

2. Initialize the shared memory object. A newly created shared memory object will have zero sizes(contains no data). You need to call ftruncate() to resize this file to a precise size in bytes (if the filesize grows, ftruncate() will initialize new space with zero). For this project, you must only create one page of shared memory. Don‚Äôt guess or hard-code this value; figure out how you can find the right page size at run-time instead. (Hint: find the page size using some system call). Again, you should read the man page of ftruncate() to understand the details.

3. Map the shared memory object into the address space. You should use mmap() and the argument flags in this routine should be MAP_SHARED because we are sharing this mapping with other processes.

must be able to handle up to 32 worker threads, so make sure the structure array you define will fit within a single page.

If anything goes wrong with this setup (e.g., the shared memory page cannot be exclusively created), then the shm_server should exit with return code 1.

4. Delete the shared memory object. How will you know when your web server is terminating? We assume that you will kill your web server program by sending it a SIGINT signal (with Ctrl-C). Usually, SIGINT interrupts your program and kills it. However, you can change this default behavior by specifying a signal handler that should be run when that particular signal is delivered. To do this, use

signal() to specify the routine that you want to run. This new routine should unmap and delete the

shared memory segment and then exit with status 0. To do so, you need to call munmap() and shm_unlink() . Again, read the manuals carefully to learn how to correctly use them!

B.2 Web server worker thread: write to the shared memory

Whenever one of your worker threads finishes an HTTP request, it should update its statistics stored in shared memory. Specifically, for each thread, you should track its thread id (obtained from pthread_self() ), the total number of HTTP requests it has completed thus far, the number of static

requests, and the number of dynamic requests).

To make sure worker threads won‚Äôt overwrite each other‚Äôs data, you should assign each worker thread a slot and it only writes to its own slot. Again, we don‚Äôt require the synchronization across the web server process and stat process, so it is okay if the stat process is reading while a web server thread is writing.

B.3 Stat process: read from the shared memory

You will need to create a separate stat process to read and display your statistics. The stat process doesn‚Äôt need to create/truncate/initialize a shared memory object, but simply map the existing shared memory object and read from it. After mapping the shared memory, your stat process will iterate between sleeping and printing forever until killed by SIGINT. Note that you don‚Äôt need to handle the signal in the stat process because it performs read-only job. It‚Äôs okay to just leave it killed.

This process, stat_process should take the following arguments: stat_process [shm_name] [sleeptime_ms] [num_threads]

shm_name : the shared memory object name (the same one passed to the web server) sleeptime_ms : Each iteration, the process should sleep for sleeptime_ms (milliseconds). The

function nanosleep is good for this functionality. When it wakes, it should read the shared statistics for every thread and print to stdout.

num_threads : the number of worker threads on the server (so the number of valid segments in the

shared memory).

If run incorrectly, it should print an error message and exit with return code 1. If the shared memory segment does not exist, it should print an error message and exit with return code 1.

For example:

will read and print stats every 1000 ms (i.e., every 1 second).

Every iteration (after it has slept 1 time), it should print the following information exactly:

For example, the following is the possible output:

Tips

1. Make sure you include proper headers to use shm_open() and mmap() . To use shm_open() , you need to use -lrt during compilation. rt is a library for real-time-related routines; prefix with l is to tell the compiler that you want to link with this library.

2. In addition to the provided client program, you can use other clients such as netcat or curl to testthe server. Netcat allows you to send data over the connection at the exact time you want to. This helps when testing your buffer implementation. Here is an example netcat command: nc localhost 8080 -C While this command is running, you can type a request (e.g. GET / HTTP/1.0 ) and then type enter twice and you should receive a response from the server.

Code Delivery

Handing in Your Code

EACH project partner should turn in their joint code to each of their handin directories.

So that we can tell who worked together on this project, each person should place a file named partners.txt in their handin/p7 directory. The format of partners.txt should be exactly as follows:

It does not matter who is 1 and who is 2. If you worked alone, your partners.txt file should have only one line. There should be no spaces within your first or last name; just use spaces to separate fields.

To repeat, both project partners should turn in their code and both should have this partners.txt file in their handin/p7 directory.

Within your p7 directory, make the following directories and place your code in them as follows:

If you wish to use slip days in this project, then you should submit your code to the corresponding slip directory: slip1, slip2, or slip3. slip1 indicates that you wish to use one slip day in this project. We will use the latest submission for grading. This means that if you submit code in folders slip3 and slip1, then we will grade the version submitted at slip3.

Will need to modify Makefile to compile, create, and clean stat_process

Testing

Ensure correct behavior from these tests before using the tester. The tester is at ~cs537-

1/tests/p7/run-tests.sh If you want to run just test n, you can run ~cs537-1/tests/p7/run-tests.sh -t n If you want to view a list of the tests you can run ~cs537-1/tests/p7/list-tests.sh Note that there will be a small number of hidden test cases (25%).

We added a debug mode so that you can see the server‚Äôs stdout and stderr in the tests-out folder. Running debug mode will usually cause the tests to fail, so if you want to actually see if you pass the tests, then don‚Äôt use debug mode. You can use debug mode by setting the TEST_DEBUG_MODE environment variable when running the tests: TEST_DEBUG_MODE=1 ~cs537-1/tests/p7/run-tests.sh Slip Day Policy

A maximum of 3 slip days can be used for this project no matter you are working with a partner or not. Additional 2 slip days for each one have been added as described in this post (https://piazza.com/class/kjn4sz4kq7t2d2?cid=596) .

If you are working with a partner, then

Each of you will only need to contribute 1/2 of any slip days you use; for example, if you use 1 slip day, each of you is charged 1/2 of a day.

If only one of you runs out of slip days, the needed slip days will be taken from the partner who still has them.

A 1/2 slip day can‚Äôt be used (unless you are combining with a 1/2 slip day from your partner). We will assume you are aware of your partner‚Äôs slip days and the implications.
